  Background: Calculator
    Given I have a simple maths calculator

    Given a variable is set to 11
    When I increment this variable by 1
    Then the variable should contain 12

  @ignore
  Scenario Outline: much more complex stuff
    Given a variable is set to <var>
    When I increment this variable by <increment>
    Then the variable should contain <result>
    Examples:
      | var | increment | result |
      | 100 | 5         | 105    |
      | 99  | 1234      | 1333   |
      | 12  | 5         | 17     |
